Analyzing the latest and the greatest data in GoodData is easy. You simply add up all sales opportunities in a revenue metric and then slice the number by sales stages, status, region, sales rep, or whatever you like. Sometimes your users start asking questions like: “What was my pipeline at the beginning of this quarter and how it has improved since then?”. You quickly realize that you need to keep the history of your opportunities and understand how any opportunity changed over time. 

This article introduces the analytic technique that we call **snapshotting**. We’ll stay in the realm of sales and describe the snapshotting on a sales automation example. Welcome to the world of opportunities, sales stages, and **change**.

NOTE: Keep in mind that you’ll hear similar questions from your help desk guy, quality guy or a head of your engineering. Snapshotting help you in these cases as well. Follow this article and substitute case, bug or feature for the opportunity.

**Sales Analytics**

Sales Analytics is all about sales opportunities that are generated by your business activities. Each opportunity has a status that describes if the opportunity is **Open** (Pipeline), **Won** (Revenue), or **Lost** (Lost Revenue).

Now our hypothetical VP of Sales, lets call him Michael asks his million dollars question: “What was my pipeline at the beginning of this quarter and how it has improved since then?”

**Snapshotting Basics**

Snapshotting is straightforward and easy to use technique that helps answering the question above. The key idea is that we keep transferring all opportunities from your CRM to GoodData every week (or day or month - it depends on your requirements). We call the weekly set of opportunities the snapshot. Each snapshot is associated with a date and unique ID.

So if we have a project that accumulates snapshots for ten weeks, most of our opportunities will be duplicated 10 times in the project. Few of them that have been created after we started snapshotting have less than 10 versions. Each version is associated with a snapshot date (perhaps Monday of each week) and a snapshot ID. It is very beneficial to use snapshot IDs in sequence without gaps. We can then simply identify previous/next snapshots as the current ID minus/plus one.

And here is the catch. A simple `SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = Open` metric measures your pipeline. But it returns a number that is roughly 10 times higher than what we expect. No wonder, because we are adding up all ten versions of each opportunity. We need to be smarter here. We can define metrics that show the total amount for individual snapshot only:

Pipeline \[10 weeks ago\]: `SELECT SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = `Open` AND SnapshotId = 1`

Pipeline \[Now\]: `SELECT SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = `Open` AND SnapshotId = 10`

Nice, easy but you’ll need a new one next week and another one week after next week. We need to generalize here and create a metric that returns the total amount for the last snapshot. Lets start with identifying the last snapshot:

Snapshot \[Most Recent\]: `SELECT MAX(SnapshotId)`

This definition sounds easy enough, however it has certain problems. Imagine that we fired a Sales Rep. John during the snapshot 5. We kept all opportunities that he has closed associated with him and re-associated all open opportunities to other guys.

Now if we break down the Snapshot \[Most Recent\] metric by the SalesRep, we will see that the metric returns 10 for all Sales Reps except John who gets the Snapshot \[Most Recent\] = 5. This is problem because we would compute our total on the snapshot 5 for John and on the snapshot 10 for everybody else. We need to improve the definition of the Snapshot \[Most Recent\] metric:

Snapshot \[Most Recent\]: `SELECT MAX(SnapshotId) BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS`

This metric returns the MAX snapshot regardless any dimensions. The last snapshot (= 10) for all Sales Reps including John, for all regions, for all Products etc. When you add the `BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS` statement to your metric it returns the grand total of all the time and all dimensions. It returns a constant.

**NOTE:** Find out more examples and aggregation concepts in [documentation](http://developer.gooddata.com/docs/maql.html). 

Then we can use the Snapshot \[Most Recent\] metric in our pipeline metric and get the latest amount this way:

Pipeline \[Now\]: `SELECT SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = Open AND SnapshotId = Snapshot [Most Recent]`

Similarly we can compute the pipeline for the first snapshot (the oldest one). The metric is:

Snapshot \[Oldest\]: `SELECT MIN(SnapshotId) BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS`

and its usage in pipeline:

Pipeline \[Oldest\]: `SELECT SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = `Open` AND SnapshotId = Snapshot [Oldest]`

**Measuring Pipeline Change in a Quarter**

The oldest and the most recent snapshots are great but we want something slightly different. We want to compute the pipeline for the first and the last snapshot in a quarter. We can achieve this by following metric definitions:

Snapshot \[First in Period\]: `SELECT MIN(SnapshotId) BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS Except SnapshotDate`

Snapshot \[Last in Period\]: `SELECT MAX(SnapshotId) BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS Except SnapshotDate`

Let’s focus on the `BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS Except` statement. Using this concept it allows you to compute total MAX/MIN of SnapshotId regardless any dimension but with exception on specific attribute. The exception is an attribute after the `Except` expression. It defines the attribute that you will slice and dice the metric with.

Do you remember the problem with sales guy John and his last snapshot 5? We use the `BY ALL IN ALL OTHER DIMENSIONS Except` concept to solve this problem. If you put the metrics above to a report with the Snapshot Quarter, you will see the first and the last snapshot ID that we have for each quarter. See the report below:

So then the pipeline at the beginning of a period is:

Pipeline \[First in Period\]: `SELECT SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = Open AND SnapshotId = Snapshot [First in Period]`

And the latest and greatest pipeline number is:

Pipeline \[Last in Period\]: `SELECT SUM(Amount) WHERE Status = Open AND SnapshotId = Snapshot [Last in Period]`

Now you just put these two metrics into a report with the Snapshot Quarter and you’ll get the pipeline at the beginning of each quarter and the last known pipeline each quarter.

You can divide or subtract these numbers to get the absolute or relative growths, whatever you need...Easy enough, isn’t it?
