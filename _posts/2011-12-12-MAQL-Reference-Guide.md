Folks,

We have something special for you today. For the last few weeks, weâ€™d been preparing the complete MAQL Reference Guide, that covers following topics:

1. MAQL Basics
2. Operators
3. Functions and macros
4. Logical Expressions
5. Common MAQL DDL Clauses
6. Common MAQL DML Clauses
7. MAQL Queries and subqueries (Metrics)

It covers the whole MAQL topic, and the complete guide has around 30 pages. As of today, you can download it and have it at your disposal while developing your Analytics App. The Reference Guide is well structured with tons of useful examples along with highlighted syntax.
