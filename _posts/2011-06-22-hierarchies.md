Tomas has published two nice articles about handling user hierarchies in GoodData. He uses variables for smart implementation of aggregating facts in user hierarchies. Here are the articles:

- [User hierarchies in GoodData](http://svarovsky-tomas.com/hierarchies.html) outlines various techniques for implementing user hierarchies 
- [How to set up a user hierarchy in GoodData](http://svarovsky-tomas.com/hierarchies-setup.html) picks one method from the article above and explains the implementation
